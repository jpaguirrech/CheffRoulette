üü¢ About Us

Chef Roulette ‚Äî bringing fun back to cooking inspiration

Hi! I‚Äôm Juan Aguirre. Like many people, I spend hours scrolling through TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube discovering incredible recipes ‚Äî but later I can never find them again.

One day, my daughter and I realized there wasn‚Äôt an easy way to save the recipes we love from social media and actually use them when we cook. That‚Äôs how Chef Roulette was born ‚Äî a digital recipe roulette that gathers your favorite dishes from any social platform and helps you decide what to cook today, in a playful, stress-free way.

The challenge was filling it with recipes we truly liked, not random database content. So we built our own smart recipe book, capable of analyzing social videos and turning them into structured recipes ‚Äî with ingredients, steps, and tags by cuisine, country, or protein.

Today, Chef Roulette is growing with the support of A4 Company S.A.S., a technology and consulting firm focused on creating purposeful digital products that simplify everyday life and spark creativity (and appetite).
